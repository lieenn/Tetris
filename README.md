# Tetris Game
Welcome to Tetris, a classic tile-matching puzzle game! This Racket-based project brings the iconic gameplay of Tetris to life. 
The goal is to complete lines by arranging falling tetrominoes to create solid horizontal rows.

Rules:
- Tetris is played on a rectangular grid where tetrominoes (composed of four square blocks each) fall from the top.
- Use arrow keys to move and rotate the falling tetrominoes to fit them into the grid.
- When a complete horizontal line is formed, it clears, and the player scores points.
- The game ends if the blocks reach the top of the grid, preventing further tetrominoes from falling.
- The player can restart the game at any time.
- As the game progresses, the falling tetrominoes speed up, challenging the player's reflexes and strategy.
